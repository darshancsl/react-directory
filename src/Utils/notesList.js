  //   question: 'What is React Fiber?',
  //   answer: 'Fiber is the new reconciliation engine or reimplementation of core algorithm in React v16. The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, gestures, ability to pause, abort, or reuse work and assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.'

  //   question: 'Why should we not update the state directly?',
  //   answer: `If you try to update the state directly then it won't re-render the component.
  //   //Wrong
  //   this.state.message = "Hello world";
  //   Instead use setState() method. It schedules an update to a component's state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.

  //   //Correct
  //   this.setState({ message: "Hello World" });
  //   Note: You can directly assign to the state object either in constructor or using latest javascript's class field declaration syntax.`
